## Steps

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
- **Install Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system. Check the version using `git --version`.
- **Configure Git**: Set up your global username and email:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
- **Verify Configuration**: Use `git config --global --list` to confirm your settings.

### 2. Set Up SSH Authentication
- **Check for Existing SSH Keys**:
    ```bash
    ls -al ~/.ssh
    ```
- **Generate a New SSH Key**:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
    ```
- **Add the SSH Key to GitHub**:
    - Copy the public key:
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ```
    - Add it to GitHub under **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.

### 3. Initialize a Local Repository
- Navigate to your project folder:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
- Initialize Git:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

### 4. Prepare Files for Commit
- **Add Files**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
- **Commit Changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

### 5. Connect to a Remote Repository
- **Add Remote Repository**:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
    ```
- **Verify Remote**:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

### 6. Push to GitHub
- **Pull Updates (if necessary)**:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
    ```
- **Push Changes**:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
