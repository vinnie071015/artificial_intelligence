1. How language models address the problem sent is a process of black box by being trained on large amounts of data.
2. Knowing this process of is vital, like 
    - what language Claude uses for thinking
    - if it can just predict the next word or does it plan ahead, vital for if it can think like human
    - Is its reasoning step-by-step? Does this precess remain the same between what it takes actually and what it tells you.
3. To research how the process works, we have to look inside to find the patterns of activity and flows of information inspired by the neuroscience.
4. 

    development of the "microscope" | AI biology | 
    the first paper | 
        action : link interpretable concepts into circuits inside a model
        result : partly revealed how the model transform the input words into output words

    the second paper| 
        action: performing deep studies of simple tasks representative of ten crucial model behaviors, including the three described above.
        result: Our method sheds light on a part of what happens when Claude responds to these prompts, which is enough to see solid evidence that:
